## Open source contributions

### NLP

- I have created a [tokenisation module](https://github.com/taranjeet/hindi-tokenizer) for Hindi language. It is useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It has 75+ stars and 70+ forks. It gets ~400 monthly user visits.

### EvalAI

- I helped develop [Evalai](https://eval.ai/) from scratch. Evalai is an open source platform for evaluating and comparing machine learning algorithms at scale.
- It gets ~42K monthly visits from ML and AI researchers and practitioners around the world. It has 1400 stars & 600+ forks on [Github](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI).
- I implemented parallelised backendÂ which reduced the submission evaluation time by 80% in comparison toÂ [Microsoft Codalab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/codalab/). This made the project popular and useful for students at CMU, Stanford and organisations like Facebook AI Research, Google AI Research.
- Evalai is a participant project under Google Summer of Code(GSOC). I was GSOC mentor for EvalAI in 2017. I was invited to GSOC mentor summit held in Google Mountain View office.
